<h2>This is heading 2</h2>
<h3>This is heading 3</h3>
<h4>This is heading 4</h4>
<h5>This is heading 5</h5>
<h6>This is heading 6</h6>

### Add Image in HTML : <img src="w3schools.jpg" alt="W3Schools.com" width="104" height="142">
  
### If for some reason image breaks alt attribute is defined to describe the image : <img src="img_girl.jpg" alt="Girl with a jacket">
  
### Changing the color of paragraph : <p style="color:red;">This is a red paragraph.</p>
  
### Using CSS we can alter the size of heading from default size : <h1 style="font-size:60px;">Heading 1</h1>
  
  
  
  
- No matter the number of new lines/spaces inside the paragraph tag the browser will ignore it. The paragraphs lines will fit the window size of browser.
